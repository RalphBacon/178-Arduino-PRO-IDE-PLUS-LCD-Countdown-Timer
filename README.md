For all the code-snobs that think the Arduino IDE is not a proper Integrated Development Environment they had better think again with this sneak first peek at the new, developed from the ground-up, PRO version!

Download it, run it directly from the download file (once unzipped), no installation required!

Let Arduino know what you think!

And another sneak peek at my forthcoming Countdown Timer using a cheap, blue LCD and acrylic case designed for it. Oh, and a Rotary Encoder, really easy to use.
